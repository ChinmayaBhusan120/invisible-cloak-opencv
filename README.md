# 🧙‍♂️ Invisible Cloak – OpenCV (Python)

A fun computer vision project inspired by **Harry Potter’s Invisible Cloak** — implemented using **OpenCV + Python**.
This project captures the background and makes any **BLUE-colored cloth** appear invisible in real-time!

##  Demo

 Works in real time using your laptop webcam.  
 Move out of the frame → background captured  
 Come back with a BLUE cloth → your body disappears 

## 📸 How It Works

The trick is simple:
1. Capture the **background** without the person.
2. Detect BLUE color using **HSV color space**.
3. Replace the BLUE area with the background.
4. Combine both frames to create the invisibility effect.
